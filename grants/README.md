- The Canada Cultural Spaces Fund (CCSF) supports the improvement of physical conditions for arts, heritage, culture and creative innovation. 
- The Fund supports renovation and construction projects, the acquisition of specialized equipment and feasibility studies related to cultural spaces.  
- Eligible applicants must be not-for-profit arts or heritage organizations with a clear artistic or heritage focus as part of their vision or mandate 
and have been active for at least two years.  
- Governments (including Indigenous governments and other Indigenous organizations with a mandate to preserve and support Indigenous heritage) are eligible to apply without that requirement, but must be able to provide evidence that they have demonstrated support to professional artistic or 
heritage activities in their community.  
- Eligible projects are feasibility studies, construction/renovation, creation of a creative hub, and/or specialized equipment purchases.  
- To be eligible, a project must be directly linked to improving conditions in spaces that are primarily used for professional arts or heritage creation, presentation 
or exhibition.

### Important points for CCSF applications: 
- all potential applicants MUST contact a CCSF program advisor before submitting a funding application 
- there is no deadline, applicants are advised to submit an application when ready, after discussion with a program advisor
- keep the application focused on the immediate project (for example, the feasibility study, not the end building)
- a maximum of 50% of the eligible budget can be requested 
- applicants must have some - ideally all - confirmed funding already in hand (minimum 66%, including whatever is being requested from CCSF)
- expenses are only eligible from the date the program receives a complete application 
- notification of funding is typically up to 30 weeks
- the program is extremely competitive and there is no guarantee of funding; any costs incurred prior to approval are at the organization's own risk 
- the Department has identified priority communities which include: indigenous, youth, official language minority, culturally diverse, and rural or remote.  The more the project benefits any of those communities directly, the stronger it becomes
- creative hubs are a new priority for the program.  Creative hubs will be assessed according to the degree to which they:
- bring together professionals from a range of arts or heritage sectors and creative disciplines;
- bring together a range of business models, such as not-for-profit and for-profit organizations and self-employed creative workers;
- provide users with affordable shared space, equipment and amenities;
- provide users with opportunities for collaboration and/or professional development; and,
- provide public access space and programming.
 

### From a CCSF perspective, the Terms of Reference of a Feasibility Study are the most important element: 
- The Terms of Reference should define the objective and scope of the feasibility study, the components that will be explored, and the expected outcome or deliverable of the study. It should also include a timeline and budget. As feasibility studies will be exploring different projects/methods/etc., the Terms of Reference should be tailored to respond to the organization’s needs and questions to determine whether and how to move forward with a potential infrastructure project. A good feasibility study will recommend what the best course of action is and tell an organization how to get there.
- Here is a summary of the terms of reference from a recent application that detailed what their feasibility study would look at (it’s for a museum, but many of the elements will be the same/similar):
   - Feasibility Study Plan
   - Consultations with Local Community
   - Funding Sources Plan (for construction and operations)
   - Development of Business Plan and Five Year Strategic Plan, including: Vision Statement; Goals and Objectives; Funding; Market Analysis; Sustainability; Operations Analysis; Publicity and Marketing
   - Development of Conceptual Plan for Museum and Capital Budget Estimates
   - Development of Conceptual Interpretation and Exhibit Plan
   - Attendance and Revenue Projections; Operating Estimates
   - Financial Models
   - Socio-Economic Benefits and Impacts

- The City of Vancouver also has some good resources for organizations that are considering doing infrastructure projects: https://vancouver.ca/people-programs/cultural-infrastructure-grant-program.aspx
