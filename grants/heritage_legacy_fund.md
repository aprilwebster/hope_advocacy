#### Heritage Designation
A form of local government land use regulation that protects private heritage property that has
been determined to have heritage value, and is intended to provide long-term protection. It is the
only form of regulation that can prohibit demolition. Heritage designation is an official listing
established under Section 954 of the Local Government Act and is created through a bylaw
passed by the municipality. Changes to a designated heritage property can only be done through
a heritage alteration permit issued by the local government. The local government can create a
list of activities that can occur without a heritage alteration permit as a schedule in the
designation bylaw. Designation on title is permanent until removed by bylaw. A local
government may designate private property without the owner’s permission, but is usually done
with mutual agreement.
